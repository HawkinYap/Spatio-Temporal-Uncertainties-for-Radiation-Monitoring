# Spatio-Temporal-Uncertainties-for-Radiation-Monitoring
It is important to deploy effective sensor networks to ensure  the safety of the nuclear power plant. For a wide coverage and  high performance to cost, calibrated professional static sensors  (SS) and homemade mobile sensors (MS) attaching to vehicles  are  in  use.  However,  the  difference  on  production  standard  inevitably  engenders  high  uncertainties  in  spatio-temporal  data, which directly undermines the reliability of analysis and  application  results.  Effective  visualizations  can  help  understand complex uncertainties through carefully designed  visualization views and interactions.  VAST  Challenge  2019  MC2  simulated  a  potential  nuclear  crisis after an earthquake in St. Himark. The available data were  mainly the radiation readings and related geo-locations for five  days from SS and MS sensors around the city. Participants were  required to use novel visualizations to analyze contamination  conditions as well as data uncertainties.  This paper proposes  an overview of our  solution  for  MC2.  The  first  part  of  our  solution  is  a  6-step  data  processing.  In  particular,  we  provide  feasible  methods  to  define  different  types  of  uncertainty  and  perform  a  hierarchical  system  for  assessment.  Then  an  interactive  interface  with  four  visualization  views  is  used  for  uncertainty  comparison  and contamination detection.
